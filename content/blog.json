I'm really enjoying how this painting is coming along but am a bit stuck on whether to leave it as it is or go into it with more detail or another figure, perhaps a bird or a rain cloud? I'm really trying to honor this moment of peace I felt looking down at the earth from a plane. I am also really into this song \"Morning Rain\" by Bob Dylan and want to add in some of that poetic imagery into this piece. But I don't want to overcrowd it and want to let the textural more abstract elements breathe. I'm not sure, so for now it's in the studio waiting for a change."
